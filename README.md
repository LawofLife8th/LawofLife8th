<!--
**LawofLife8th/LawofLife8th** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on trying to get a job so I can get my own
my own computer so I can learn coding and stuff so I can make my own games
Instead of always playing other people's games all the time.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... well I'm not learning anything at this point in time 
So until I get myself a computer u won't be learning much for now.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... future projects of me and the games that I plan
To make.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... coding blending animating GFXs the list can go on
But I am unable to pay for someone to do so for me at this moment so I'll hold on that for now.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about ... Yall can ask me whatever yall want I'll answer then to the best of my abilities.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: ... For anyone who wishes to reach out to me I have a Twitter that u can reach out to me on 
But I prefer u to use my email (lifemakersyum@gmail.com) is u need anything from me I'll do my best to reply as fast 
As I can.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... My Pronouns are Him He and His so yea ima guy xD.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... Hmmm fun facts? I guess there would be only one right now
And that would be that I like to play rhythm games. So yeah that's about it for me.
